# train_scheduler
This train scheduler is a web-based application that uses Firebase, HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
When adding trains, administrators can submit the following: Train Name Destination First Train Time -- in military time Frequency -- in minutes. This app is coded to calculate when the next train will arrive;  which is relative to the current time. Users from many different machines are able to view same train times.
